HiPCMS Angular2 App
===================

HiP-CmsAngularApp is a content management system which is developed by the project group [History in 
Paderborn](http://is.uni-paderborn.de/fachgebiete/fg-engels/lehre/ss15/hip-app/pg-hip-app.html).
It is developed to fill the system 'History in Paderborn' with data. This is only a client application. We 
also develop a [REST API](https://github.com/HiP-App/HiP-CmsWebApi) which provides service end points. The REST API is built on .NET Core 1.0.

In another team of the project group, an Android app is developed that will 
make the content of HiPCMS accessable to the public. Information about the app 
will be added as soon as it is available.

HiPCMS will replace the original project which was known as [HiPBackend](https://hip.upb.de/).
HiPBackend's code unfortunately was not maintainable anymore and a rewrite was decided.
